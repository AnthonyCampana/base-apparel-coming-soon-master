## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

From this challenge I was able to learn how to manipulate the DOM based on user input and change the DOM based on if the user provided a valid input or not. 

### Useful resources

- [mdn mozilla web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content) - I utilized the resource by learning more about the properties I needed to replicate the design given
- [Stack Oveflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions) - This helped me understand the properties and layout I need to the button and its effects.
